For my senior design project, I partnered with another student to create a rhythm game in the style of Guitar Hero and Rock Band using real instruments. We used a keyboard and guitar as the instruments. Physically, it consisted of a microprocessor running the main game software, an FPGA driving the game graphics, and a digital signal processor handling the guitar note detection and scorekeeping. I worked primarily on the signal processing while my partner worked on the game software. We both created custom PCBs for the project as well as an overall enclosure.
