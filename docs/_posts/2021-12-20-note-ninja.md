For my senior design project, I partnered with another student to create a rhythm game in the style of Guitar Hero and Rock Band using real instruments. We used a keyboard and guitar as the instruments. Physically, it consisted of a microprocessor running the main game software, an FPGA driving the game graphics, and a digital signal processor handling the guitar note detection and scorekeeping. I worked primarily on the signal processing while my partner worked on the game software. We both created custom PCBs for the project as well as an overall enclosure.

Original PCB... The chip fried and they went out of stock, so I had to switch to a slightly different chip (already had on a dev board)
