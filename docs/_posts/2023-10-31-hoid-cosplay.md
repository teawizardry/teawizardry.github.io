This year for Halloween I wanted to dress up as Hoid from Tress of the Emerald Sea. I drew a pattern based on the illustration in the book, which was fun as I hadn't drawn any tiling patterns before. Due to time constraints and cost, I ordered a custom printed shirt on Etsy with the pattern. I already had the shirt and socks. I got the shorts from Spirit of Halloween and borrowed the birks. The only thing that didn't work out well was the white hair spray I got. I had to use the entire can and then add baby powder to my hair to even get the illusion of vaguely grey hair. If I do this again, I'd probably try white hair wax or just give up and not color my hair. A wig would also probably work.

From the book:
> Heâ€™s on this ship. And he has a pair of bright red sequined briefs.

> I was wearing a floral buttoned shirt, shorts that were way too short, and sandals.
With socks.
