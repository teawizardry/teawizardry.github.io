For Halloween, I dressed as plague doctor. It was a ton of fun to make and I'll definitely be adding more to the costume in the future. Before I get into the process, here are some photos of the final product:

For the mask, I followed [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgAM54k0Xw&t=506s). I used random stuff around my house like balled up tin foil to texture the mask. I used painting techniques from various model paintings I'd seen online.

I bought a shirt that I thought would match the outfit as I didn't really feel compelled to make one. For the cloak, I was gifted a brown cloak that I added decorative trim to. I decided to use pants I had previously made for a (somewhat) historically accurate pirate costume.

With the base outfit complete, I scoured a local market for props to great success. This cool syringe from the 1800s and tiny bottles for potions were great additions. I also bought a plague doctor belt from Spirit Halloween that I modified to look more steampunk.

In the future, I hope to have a proper bag and some more thematic props. Perhaps giant scissors, more potion bottles, and other fun things.
