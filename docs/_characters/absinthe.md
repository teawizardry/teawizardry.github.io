<details><summary>Setting</summary>
I have played Dr. Absinthe in a cyberpunk red game and once in a normal DnD setting. However, their character originates from an original setting I've been making (and hope to do some writing with and run some Monster of the Week games in when I have time). It takes place in an alternate future, where society has collapsed and started to rebuild, and people can be bound to different elements. It's a little bit magical detective stories, a little bit cyberpunk, a little bit solarpunk, and a little bit whacky fun. Anyways, the main elements no matter what the setting is for Dr. Absinthe are that he's unhinged, a doctor of some sort, and has daddy issues.

<details open><summary>Appearance</summary>
<b>Skelly Form:</b> Their bones are a light green and will glow in dim light or when using his powers. His eye sockets also have a glowing light in them. 

<b>Human Form:</b> He has lightly wavey auburn brown hair, light facial hair (usually some form of goatee and mustache), and green eyes.

Their fashion varies by time and setting, but usually it's a little dramatic.
</details>

<details open><summary>Personality</summary>
They have a bit of a Machiavellian flair, being very patient and cunning when it comes to accomplishing their goals. At the same time, he easily falls into overindulgence of whatever is his current vice. He does not make friends easily, but when he does they're fiercely loyal. Basically, they're a man of extremes. He's not one to half ass things.
