<details><summary>Setting</summary>
I play Damien a slightly homebrewed Forgotten Realms setting (basically, little bit of steampunk has been added since it's "in the future" of the current 5e timeline, plenty of VR's guide / dread plane shenanigans, and ignoring any problematic WoTC weirdness).
</details>

<details open><summary>Appearance</summary>
Damien wears mostly dark or neutral colors and classier styles, but wears outfits with a little more flair to it on occassion. I change his hair around every so often, so the exact style and whether he does or doesn't have facial hair is fluid. The symbols on his necklace are the symbols of Mystra and Eilistraee. He also has a holy symbol of Mystra that he doesn't always wear openly but always has on his person. He doesn't need glasses to see, but he does have a pair of magical golden glasses (explained below) that he wears while reading.
</details>

<details open><summary>Personality</summary>
Damien tends towards the pessimistic side. He is quiet and reserved, preferring to be by himself or with a few close friends than in a crowd. He tries to maintain an image of indifference, but inside he's actually quite caring and a complete softy. When confronted with trouble (usually self-inflicted) his first instinct is to deflect and run away from his problems (he's working on that). While he usually tries to maintain a straight face, he tends to wear his heart on his sleeve if you know what to look for. When his emotions do boil over, his mouth tends to get him in trouble. If met with his anger, you'll usually find apology coffee waiting for you the next day.
