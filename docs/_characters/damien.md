<details><summary>Setting</summary>
I originally created Damien as a side / backup character for the DnD game I play in. It's set in a slightly homebrewed Forgotten Realms setting (basically, little bit of steampunk added by virtue of it being a bit "in the future" of the current 5e setting and plenty of VR's guide / dread plane shenanigans involved).
