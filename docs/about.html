<p>Welcome to my site!</p>

<p>I'm a graduate student whose research mainly focuses on non-traditional, off-silicon methods for image processing, computer vision, and computational photography. Outside of my studies, I enjoy art, history, and whatever random topic my brain has latched on to for the moment.</p>
